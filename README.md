# Human-Activity-Recognition

Human activity recognition with pose estimation using shift invariant technique involves two main modules: pose estimation and activity recognition. The shift invariant technique, which is the foundation of the pose estimation module, is intended to precisely estimate the pose of a human body from a single RGB image. By training convolutional neural networks with shift-invariant feature representations of individual body components, the shift invariant approach can estimate the pose of the entire body. Based on machine learning algorithms that have been taught using pose estimations, the activity identification module can identify particular human activities. The suggested technique has a number of benefits over conventional methods for recognising human activities. First, activity recognition is more accurate thanks to the shift invariant technique's excellent accuracy and efficiency for pose estimation.
# Algorithm: Conventional LSTM
A conventional LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that is designed to address the vanishing gradient problem of traditional RNNs. The vanishing gradient problem occurs when gradients become exponentially small as they are backpropagated through many time steps, making it difficult for the model to learn long-term dependencies.

The LSTM architecture consists of a cell state, which is a long-term memory that can be read, written to, and erased selectively. It also includes three gates: an input gate, a forget gate, and an output gate. These gates regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell state.

# Advantages
The shift invariant technique for pose estimation is highly accurate and efficient, resulting in more accurate activity recognition.

The use of machine learning algorithms for activity recognition allows for the system to adapt to different activities and to learn from new data, resulting in better performance over time. 

The use of a single RGB camera for both pose estimation and activity recognition makes the system more affordable and accessible compared to traditional approaches that require multiple cameras or specialized hardware.
